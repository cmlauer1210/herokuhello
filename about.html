  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>This is an About page for Chris Lauer. I grew up Indiana and went to Indiana University. During college I worked for Southwestern selling educational resources door to door. After Southwestern, I moved to California. I proceeded to continue working at Southwestern and after the summer of 2009, I backpacked all through South America. When I finished my trip I returned to San Francisco and began my career as a Recruiter. After 3 solid years at Andiamo, I have decided to pursue additional opportunities. I am very excited about the opportunity at Heroku and look forward to having an opportunity to work alongside the Heroku team.</p>
